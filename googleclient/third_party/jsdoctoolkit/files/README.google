Description:
The jsdoctoolkit reads jsdoc comments from javascript files and
generates reference documentation, typically as html files although
that can be configured.

Local Modifications:
Changed a few line in app/iib/JSDOC/SymbolSet.js in the function
JSDOC.SymbolSet.prototype.walk. The issue is the jsdoctoolkit expects @extends
to use no brackets around the type. but the google JSCompiler expects brackets.
This change makes @externs work with brackets.
