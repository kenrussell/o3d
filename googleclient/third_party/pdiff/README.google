Description:
PerceptualDiff is an image comparison utility that makes use of a 
computational model of the human visual system to compare two images.

Local Modifications:
An "-ignoreEdges e (0 to 7)" option is added to the original version,
which can turn on the edge detection function and prevent edges in
the images from being checked during comparison.
Parameter e is the max number of neighbors the pixel can have to be
considered as edge. If e is a large value, like 6 or 7, more possible
edges would be ignored during comparison, if e is a small value near 0,
only scattered points would be ignored from being checked.
Edge detection function employs convolution with a 
3-by-3 kernel:
-1 -1 -1
-1  8 -1
-1 -1 -1
It will first detect edges in the original pdiff output image,
and create a new pdiff result by substracting edges from the original
output image, and also recalculate unmatched pixels to make results
consistent.
