This version of V8 has been modified for Client3D.
- Removed #define _HAS_EXCEPTIONS 0, which was causing compilation errors
- Changed compiler and linker options in SConstruct to be compatible with C3D
- Changed the build_dir
- Removed "_g" suffix from debug binaries (we don't use that convention - they
  go in a different directory)
